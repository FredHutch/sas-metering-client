### Requirements

- Microsoft Windows 7+
- Administrative privileges to install it as a service

- Open a command-line shell with administrative permissions

Run the follow commands:

### SAS Simulator

SAS is not free and obtaining a trial version for testing is not trivial, so to test this monitoring agent, Iâ€™ve written a SAS simulator. 

To run it just download "sas-simulator/binary/sas.exe" from this repo to your windows computer and run it via the command-line of double-click in Windows explorer.
